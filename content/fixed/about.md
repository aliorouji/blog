I'm Ali Orouji, a computer engineer who is a bit more social than the other computer engineers. I was born in Miyana (a little town in East Azerbaijan, Iran) in 1992, but didn't stay there for a long time. We traveled across the country and lived in many cities. Currently I'm in Tehran, working at Cafebazaar as a software engineer.

In this blog, I'm going to express my thoughts on many related or unrelated issues to my profession. The posts will be in English, Farsi and Turkish.
